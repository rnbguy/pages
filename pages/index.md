# pages

minimal static site generator for a personal site. built on deno, markdown, and
a tiny amount of custom glue.

fork it at: https://github.com/rnbguy/pages

## quick start

1. **clone this repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rnbguy/pages my-site
   cd my-site
   ```

2. **update config**

   edit `config.yaml` with your details:
   ```yaml
   title: your site name
   url: https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo
   github: yourusername
   # optional: add twitter, image, etc.
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > if this repo is your `username.github.io` repository, use
   > `username.github.io` as your url

3. **add your content**

   write markdown files in the `pages/` directory:
   ```bash
   # create a new page
   cat > pages/hello.md << 'EOF'
   ---
   title: hello world
   description: my first page
   ---

   this is my first page!
   EOF
   ```

4. **commit and push**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "initial site setup"
   git push origin main
   ```

5. **enable github pages**

   - go to your repo on github: settings > pages.
     - https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo/settings/pages
   - set source to "github actions".

   that's it - the included workflow will deploy automatically

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > if you intend to (or already) use a custom domain for github pages, use
   > `thatwebsite.com/repo-name` or just `thatwebsite.com` accordingly
